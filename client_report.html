    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?
        - Once I knew the direction I wanted to take the project, which was to make a memory
        page for my mission, I broke it into three important sections, the most
        meaningful parts of my mission: fun stories, companions, and baptisms. From there
        I found pictures of all my companions, my baptisms, and a few fun stories from the
        home page.</p>

    <p>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?
        - We communicated larger over text. He would report to me when parts of the website had
        been completed by the developers, and I would look them over and let him know what I thought,
        changes that could be made, and it all worked great. There were no communication issues.</p>

    <p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?
        - He absolutely did! I love the way he did the colors and the styles, for me it really fit 
        the vibe of my mission and it really made me happy seeing all those memories in one place
        to remember and look back on those good times.</p>

    <p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?
        - Next time I'll find a different way to draw up my wireframe, it worked out fine in the end
        but there were a few things that I needed to clarify because those things were hard to include 
        clearly in the wireframe. Next time I think i'll use a word document or a google drawing or something
    </p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?
        - We started by making a group chat for our team, and from then I would send assignments
        there, and my junior developers asked questions and coordinated putting everything together.
        We had one point where there was an option to get photos of all of us for the about us page, so we
        sent pictures into that chat so Cody could get his work done before his wisdom teeth extraction</p>

    <p>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?
        - My client was Parker Dragovich. Communication was quite easy, we exchanged phone numbers and 
        I sent him updates during the project so he could give us feedback. When I had questions, it was 
        super easy to go ask him. There were no communication issues.</p> 

    <p>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?
        - Publishing the site was really easy, I made sure to communicate to my junior devs
        to be sure to pull the origin before making edits and all went well. I sent Parker the link to the 
        live website so he could give us feedback, and all was great.</p>

    <p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?
        - I touched on this a bit in the last question, but we did not have any problems with losing data 
        from the sites. I stressed to Hunter and Cody the importance of pushing and pulling the origins
        at the right time to github, and we got through without any issues. It was a great success.
    </p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?
        - I communicated with my team leads through email. It was pretty easy with Einar, he was really on top of it.
        The only difficulty I can think of came near the end when one of my emails didn't make it to him. I would have much rather
        had a group chat but the consensus was that my leads didn't want to do that. It seemed like there was a lack of active communication
        between me and Jacob, but it worked out fine, the websites turned out great. Overall exchanging numbers is a better idea.</p>

    <p>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?
        - Yes! The responsibilities were mostly clear for each site. Near the end of the site we did for Angelique, the wireframe just kind
        of ended, but it wasn't too bad because I just followed the set pattern and it worked great. The only other thing that was unclear
        was the two webpages that I had to take over on the skinner project. After looking it over though it got cleared up.</p>

    <p>Were you able to contribute to your sites?
        - Absolutely! I feel good about what I contributed to each site.</p>

    <p>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?
        - Nope! Everything worked great, we focused a lot on making sure nothing got deleted when pushing changes to github.
    </p>

    <h2>Overall Experience Report</h2>
    <p>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?
        - I think the most challenging part of this project was balancing each project, making sure each one got
        the attention it needed and that I was communicating with all 4 teams I was a part of. What I did to overcome it
        was keep an open directory in VS Code so I wouldn't forget about one of the sites. Also every time I took down a contact
        I labeled it with the directory name to stay organized.</p>

    <p> What did you enjoy most about this project?
        - I enjoyed most seeing different ideas from different clients and developers come together to put a vision onto
        the screen, that was really cool to see how efficiently one team can work to build a site.</p>

    <p>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?
        - I think I would have spent more time meeting with my group outside of class. I think if we had at least had a few calls
        in between class time to coordinate our work then that would have made it more efficient.</p> 

    <p>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.
        - I definitely do to an extent! I was thinking about the group format and how this would help us prepare
        for the real world. Given also that we would likely be a part of one time instead of four at a time, I feel confident
        that I can jump into a team environment and perform within the framework. Teamwork has always been a talent of mine, and
        I'm excited to experience working with a team more to complete projects like this.
